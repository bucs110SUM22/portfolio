# CS110 Summer `22 Portfolio Repository

This is your porfolio for the semester. All your work, besides the final project, will go into here.

You will submit your portfolio for the Midterm, and I will review and grade everything up through Chapter 7 material. The second half of the course you will have a chance to correct any issues in the first half submissions, and complete your portfolio.

At the end of the semester, you will submit your complete portfolio. You can contact me for help with code or material concepts using the methods described below.

***WARNING***

The syllabus has suggested due dates. All chapters build on the previous chapter's materials, so I highly recommend trying to stick to the suggested schedule as much as possible.
