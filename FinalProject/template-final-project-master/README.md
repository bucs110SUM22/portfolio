        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module

## Class Interface Design

    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.

## Data Permanence

## User Interface Design

* << You should  have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

* main.py
* src
    * <all of your python files should go here>
* assets
    * <all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here)
* etc
    * <This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project. Your demo video should go here.>
